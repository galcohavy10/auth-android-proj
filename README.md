## Introduction
Hey guys,

Multiple people will be working on this project simultaneously to see who can build the best one. Do not upload your work to GitHub until June 20th.

Create the code on your computer and you will have a chance to make a commit later on.

You are tasked with converting the existing SwiftUI (iPhone) Views `AuthenticationView()`, `LogInView()`, `SignUpView()` and -this part is optional-`LearnMoreView()` to Kotlin for Android. You are striving to bring a seamless user experience to both iOS and Android users. Meaning they should be almost exactly the same.

## Setup and Requirements

For this project, you will need Android Studio installed on your computers. It's the official IDE for Android development and offers everything you need to build apps for every type of Android device. 

You can download Android Studio [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/). Upon successful installation, create a new Android Project and use Kotlin as your programming language.

## Setting up the Environment

1. Start Android Studio and select "Create New Project."
2. On the "Create Android Project" window, choose "Empty Activity" for this project.
3. Select Kotlin as your language.
4. Choose a minimum SDK that supports the features you want.
5. Finish the setup and wait for the project's initial build to complete.

## Project Task Details

1. **Conversion of Swift to Kotlin:** Your main task is to convert the attached Swift files: `AuthenticationView()`, `LogInView()`, and `SignUpView()`, into Kotlin. 

   - **AI Assistance:** To assist you with the conversion, I recommend using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) with GPT-4. It is available for a $20/month subscription, but the investment is truly worthwhile. It can help with error detection, code conversion ideas, and understanding complex concepts.
   
   - After using AI for the initial conversion, be prepared to dive into the Kotlin code yourself. The AI isn't perfect, and manual revision is necessary to ensure the code is accurate and efficient.

   - **YouTube:** Grind your teeth and get through some long videos, they're exremely beneficial. I recommend watching longer videos and coding along with them if you're confused about the language. Just google something like "How to build basic android app on android studio Kotlin"

2. **Using Kotlin:** Learning a new language is challenging, but don't get disheartened. Remember to take breaks when you need them. Kotlin's official documentation is comprehensive and can be found [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html). It's a great resource, and I encourage you to refer to it as needed. Don't forget to ask ChatGPT to break down complex concepts for you - it's a great tool for learning! 

3. **Create Placeholder Functions:** Without server access at the moment, your task is to create placeholder functions for the provided API functions (see the attachment below). Include logic pseudocoded for each placeholder function, ensuring you understand the purpose of each function. This will be essential for future implementation.

   - For example, if you have a login API function, you could pseudocode a function that accepts a username and password as input and returns a success or failure message.

4. **Testing:** Regular testing is vital to catch any bugs early on. Android Studio provides built-in tools for testing your app, either on actual Android devices or on emulators. Make sure your Kotlin code works as expected by running frequent tests.


## Ending Notes
Please ensure all code is cleanly formatted, well-documented, and adheres to general coding standards (spaced, comments that say why this is here not what it is). 

As always, don't hesitate to ask me any questions (no such thing as a stupid question) if you're stuck. And remember, it's a learning process, so it's okay to make mistakes or struggle.

Let's aim to do your best in this project. Enjoy the grind!

I know this shit is painful, but, you got this. Seriously we all suck in the beginning („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•


Remember, coding is as much about resilience as it is about actual skill. The difficulties you overcome today are the foundations for the fucking wins of tomorrow.

 **Keep pushing, keep learning, and keep coding!**
